# Military-Logbook
Program that allows you to log a flight, tells you your semi annual requirements and where you are at, and possibly scans your military records to import flights.
early work in progress for school project.
Goals are to manually log flight time. Log flight time by mode of flight. Keep track of semi anual requirements and APART requirements.
additionally if able I would like to find a way to import -12 summaries to this logbook.
